                    need</h2>
                <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve
                    my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing
                    some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell
                    phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more
                    sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble)
                    made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that
                    the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.</p>
